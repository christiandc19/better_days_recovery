              <h1>Comprehensive Care for Veterans</h1>
              <p>
                Veterans often face distinct challenges that can lead to substance use, including PTSD, depression, and other service-related trauma. Our program integrates evidence-based therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), to address these underlying issues and promote lasting recovery.
                <br /> Our team understands the complexities of military life and provides compassionate, respectful care designed to meet each veteranâ€™s personal recovery goals. We work to help veterans break free from addiction, regain their health, and rebuild a fulfilling life post-service.
